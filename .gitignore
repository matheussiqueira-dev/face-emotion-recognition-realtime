# Keep the manually downloaded/needed XML if desired, but usually we ignore large binaries. 
# However, for this project to be portable, we might want to track the XML if it's small (<1MB) or ignore it.
# The user wants to push the project, let's keep the XML if it's important fix.
# But generally standard is to ignore. The code redownloads it. Let's ignore it to keep repo clean.
